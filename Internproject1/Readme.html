This is my first data analytics project that is titled itle: Bank Churn Model

Objective: The aim of this project is to classify the bank customers who have chances of leaving
the bank that is churn over here. Now this pattern is not even or balanced so we are considering 
that even if there is unbalance how by using machine learning suitable model we can increase the 
performance of the model. Here are points we shall we implementing for project: 
1.Data Encoding 
2.Feature Scaling 
3.Handling Inbalance Data By:
a.Random Under Sampling
b.Random Over Sampling 
4.Support Vector Machine Classification 
5.Grid Search for Hyperparameter tunning.
